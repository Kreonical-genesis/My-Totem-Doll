- Ported to 1.21.6â€“7 (screw them with their new render caching, but in some ways I like it)
- Reworked rendering shenanigans for 1.21.6 support, this also (probably) means better arms handling, when doll should use slim or wide arms
- Fixed elytra model for 3d doll
- Dolls on Welcome Screen now have your current skin
- Fixed issue with crashing after resource reloading
